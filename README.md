# An extremely simple python program that creates reddit accounts
(Note: it still needs the user to do the captcha)
### Needs Selenium and polling2 (pip install Selenium) (pip install polling2) and geckodriver (firefox)
## How to use

Download it/clone repo

extract file to a spare folder

open said folder and open a CMD in it
type ```pip install selenium``` click enter, then  type ```pip install polling2``` and click enter
type ```py creator.py``` and it'll run

## TODO:

1.Proxy or Tor implementation

2.maybe make it faster?

3.putting the information of the account that was made into a text file Cancel changes (done)

4.(LAST ON MY LIST BECAUSE FUCK IT) auto captcha solver




# Note: only tested and fixed creator.py for now, also very barebones
