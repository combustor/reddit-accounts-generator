# An extremely simple python program that creates reddit accounts
(Note: it still needs the user to do the captcha)
### Uses geckodriver (firefox) and HTTPS proxies
## How to use

Download it/clone repo

extract file to a spare folder

open said folder and open a CMD in it

type ```` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ````

and click enter

add HTTPS proxies to proxy.txt

open creator.py in a text editor/notepad and change your default email and default password.  Save the file and then type in the command line ```py creator.py``` or ```` python3 creator.py````. 


and it'll run

## TODO:

1.Proxy or Tor implementation (done)

2.maybe make it faster?

3.putting the information of the account that was made into a text file Cancel changes (done)

4.(LAST ON MY LIST BECAUSE FUCK IT) auto captcha solver




# Note: only tested and fixed creator.py for now, also very barebones
